2. System Workflow

Think about how the system flows:

Patient registers or logs in.

Patient views outstanding bills.

Patient chooses payment option (Card, Bank Transfer, Insurance, etc.).

System integrates with a payment gateway.

Transaction confirmed → updates hospital records.

Receipt generated (PDF/email).

Admin dashboard updates with reports.
